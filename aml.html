          <br>
          <p>Experience the seamless power of our Automated Model Selection and Optimization (AMSO-AI) system, where you have the freedom to be as involved as you want in the model selection and optimization process. We understand that machine learning can be complex, which is why our AMSO-AI system simplifies the journey for you. From defining your goals to deploying models on new data and continuously improving them, our automated approach revolutionizes the way you leverage machine learning.</p>

          <h3>Defining the Data</h3>
          <p>QSC's AMSO-AI system puts you in control right from the start. Define the nature of your target variable, whether it's continuous, like revenue, or discrete, like success/failure. Our intelligent software provides tailored recommendations based on your data, but you can actively participate in the process or leverage our suggestions if you prefer a more hands-off approach.</p>

          <h3>Selecting Model Options</h3>
          <p>With our AMSO-AI system, you have the flexibility to choose your level of involvement. We recommend machine learning methods suitable for your data types and provide default hyperparameter values for testing. You can explore additional hyperparameter values or trust our automation to handle the selection and fine-tuning process. It's your choice, ensuring a customized approach that suits your unique requirements.</p>

          <h3>Model Testing, Optimization, and Deployment</h3>
          <p>Our AMSO-AI system goes beyond model selection and optimization. We split your dataset into training and validation groups, evaluating performance metrics tailored to your specific question. Once we identify the optimal model(s), they can effortlessly be deployed on new data as it arrives.</p>
          <p>Our automation takes care of making predictions, enabling you to gather real-time insights without any manual intervention. But that's not all â€“ our system offers an extra layer of vigilance by providing real-time alerts via text or email. You'll receive instant notifications if concerns or extreme results arise, allowing you to take immediate action and stay ahead of potential challenges. Furthermore, our system ensures continuous improvement by automatically re-training the models at regular intervals as new data becomes available. This seamless process guarantees that your models stay up-to-date and evolve with your changing needs.</p>

          <h3>Unlock the true potential of your data with our Automated Model Selection and Optimization (AMSO-AI) system</h3>
          <p>Whether you prefer a hands-on approach or want to rely on our advanced automation, our platform empowers you to make informed decisions with ease. Deploy models, receive real-time predictions, and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with automatic re-training and instant alerts. Elevate your machine learning capabilities and gain a competitive edge with our comprehensive AMSO-AI solution today.</p>
